Adding images

Today we are Working on images. The things that could go wrong include:
If the file name is incorrect, the image will not run
If the extension is wrong, the image won't run
If the file type is wrong, the image won't run
ps valid file types include jpg (my-image.jpg)
                            gif (my-imgage.gif)
                            png (my-image.png)
                            svg (my-image.svg)



Cloning a Repository from Github

The Steps include
1) Fork the Repository
2) Clone your Fork ($ git clone [url])
3) Create a branch (usually this is done using git branch [branch name])
4) Open the folder you want to look at on you editor of choice
5) Things you could do once you have a copy of the repository on your editor include;
replicate the page you want to edit using:
  basic HTML elements (paragraphs, anchors, images, etc.)
  sectioning elements (header, section, article, nav, footer, etc.)
6) Commit your changes appropriately
7) Push your changes
8) Open a pull request
