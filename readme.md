Adding images

Today we are Working on images. The things that could go wrong include:
If the file name is incorrect, the image will not run
If the extension is wrong, the image won't run
If the file type is wrong, the image won't run
ps valid file types include jpg (my-image.jpg)
                            gif (my-imgage.gif)
                            png (my-image.png)
                            svg (my-image.svg)
